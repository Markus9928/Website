                    <center><h1>My Rating</h1></center>
                    <center><p>I think the Book is one of the greatest books written in the 20th centurie. Not only did I feel as if I was in the story itself while reading but the topics it talks about even haunted me when i was not reading. It was thrilling, shocking educational and sometimes so detailed you might think that Orwell is actually just describing something that realy exists, not something that he immaginated <br/><br/>I rate this book:  <b>double-plus good</b></p></center>
                    <br/><br/><br/>
                    <center><h1>The Guardian</h1><p>Perhaps the most powerful, effective and frightening notion of 1984 is that the complete control of an entire nation under a totalitarian state is perfectly possible. If the world fell under the control of one or even multiple dictators, the future could easily become a twisted, cruel world where every movement, word and breath is scrutinised by an omnipotent, omnipresent power that no one can stop, or even oppose without the fear of death.</p><br/><p>Orwellâ€™s novella is a warning for the human race. It highlights the importance of resisting mass control and oppression.</p></center>
