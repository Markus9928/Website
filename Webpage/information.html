          <p>The book is a dystopian novel which means that it is depicting a possible or impossible worst case scenario future. It was written as a warning for everyone to never let anything similar happen. The author took a lot of inspiration not only from Stalins Regime in Russia but also from Hitler, Mussolini and Franco and created in this book the perfect totalitarian system in which even the minds of the people could be controlled.<br/><br/>The effect the book had on me was as expected i think: I noticed the small things that are moving us towards a world like the one in the book. The cameras that are without us really noticing everywhere around us or the news we read, who are never really objective but always in some way biased</p>
