He was also a supporter of the socialists which can all be found also in his books. He used his books, over all 1984 as a warning for all of us. He wanted to show people the worst he could immagine as a way of telling them to make sure not to ever let this happen in reality. He also worked with the Burmese Police as a police officer which as you can immagine sometimes tortured people.
